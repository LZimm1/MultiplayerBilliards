# Multiplayer Billiards

Classic 8 Ball pool with full-functioning multiplayer mode. With this game, you can play a friend right next to you using offline mode, or play friends from all across the globe using multiplayer mode. Multiplayer mode was created using Photon. This game was very difficult to make, as I had to teach myself Photon with zero experience, and took me much longer than any other previous project has. Please leave any feedback you may have in the comments.
